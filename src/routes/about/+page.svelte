<h1>About</h1>
<p>As of January 2024 this website is a work in progress</p>
<p>I'm publishing it now because if I don't I'll fiddle around with it forever & to live with it will help me understand where I want to take it</p>
<p>My old books page can be found <a href="https://www.toffeemilkshake.co.uk/books">here</a></p>
<h2>Aims</h2>
<ul class="aims">
  <li>More colorful than the old page</li>
  <li>Include photos of books covers</li>
  <li>Allow for notes on books</li>
  <li>... and links to related webpages etc.</li>
</ul>

Depressing but important and ultimately positive regarding the choices we make about how to live in the end of our life. I'd be interested to see how the UK context differs from the US regarding care homes; in the US apparently sharing rooms is normal whereas over here in the UK that's unheard of-- make me wonder about other differences.

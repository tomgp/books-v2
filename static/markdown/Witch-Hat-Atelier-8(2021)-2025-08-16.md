Blasted through a couple of volumes on this on the way back from holiday in Austria. I often feel like manga can lose steam once the initial world building is established and the characters fall into a set of defined relationships. Kamome Shirahama manages to keep realising more space in her world though, without having to expand it constantly, just teasing out the implications of what's already established. Just really good and it looks lovely too.

I really liked the start of this but as it went on I just became less interested. Better when it's a memoir than when it's a social history, better as social history than cultural commentary. The music chapter was the most frustrating (and I think Scott might see it as the fulcrum of the book), I mean I like Badly Drawn Boy I guess but David Scott wants me to believe he represents and important cultural phenomonon(?) and I don't buy it. And it feels odd to talk about non-Oasis mancunian music in the 90s and not mention M People (or if your going to talk about New Order/ Joy Division why not The Fall?).

I’ve been reading Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell to K- over the last while. We’re about half way through. It’s really great, and fun to read out loud (I think I’m getting pretty good at reading out lound). Interesting particularly in the light of Vanity fair which is similar thickness and similar time scale. I wonder if ther are interesting comparisons to be drawn between Becky and Amelia/ Strange and Norell? Frenemies in the time of Napoleon.

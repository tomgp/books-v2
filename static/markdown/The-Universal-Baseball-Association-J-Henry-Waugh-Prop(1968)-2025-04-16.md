I expect I would have got more from this if I'd had the slightest idea of how baseball works, normally this would be a problem in reading a book that consists 75% by volume of descriptions of (imaginary) baseball matches, but the writing here is great. The few depictions of women are er... a little troubling to put it mildly and I suspect one reason why Coover's reputation has not persisted, but still, it's a shame this is out of print, I think it probably deserves an audience inspite of its flaws. The books is interesting on all sorts of levels beyond the prose, it has things to say about our relationship to sport, work, games, chance, and eventually religion, as well as specifically being of interest to those of us interested in dice and tables.

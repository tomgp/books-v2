Saramago is always good, but this is probably the novel of his I have got the least from. As always Saramago procedes gently forward narrating the events of his fable from a strange position of both naivety and wisdom. There's laughs along the way but the climax is tragedy.

Le Guin writes in her review of The Elephant's Journey

>To [Saramago]] "man" is not the sole subject of human interest, in whom all value and meaning inheres, but a member of a large household. Saramago's reminder to us that we aren't the be-all and end-all of creation is, usually, a dog. I developed a simple ranking system for his fiction: the books with a dog are better than the ones with no dog; the more important the dog, the better the book.

I think this is correct. The Double does have a dog in it but it makes only a brief appearance.

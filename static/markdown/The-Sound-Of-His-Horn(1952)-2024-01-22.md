Couldn't sleep during last nights big storm so read this in the early hours of the morning. It's pretty trashy but taut well written trashy. The Schloss where the Nazi hunt master rules is really well realised, a labyrinth of buildings and trees a third ruined medieval village a third Bond villains layer and a third brothers Grimm forrest. Will be stealing it for a DnD campaign if I get the chance.

Also: perhaps interesting to think about in realtion to [The Island of Dr Moreau](http://localhost:5173/book-The-Island-of-Dr-Moreau(1896)).

_Notes after reading both this book and [Ancillary Sword](/book-Ancillary-Sword(2014))_

Having finally got around to writing something down about these two Chrome crashed and I lost it.

So, short Version:

 * Imperial Rome in space – I like stuff about Rome and I like space.
 * The use of she/her for everyone in the book (male or female the Radsch culture doesn’t have that distinction) works very well indeed, a clear improvement on Le Guin’s flawed decision to stick with male pronouns in Left Hand….
 * The gender, colonialism, identity stuff is on the table and interesting enough but never gets in the way of space battles and assasination and so on.
 * Seems like there’s still an awful lot of ground to cover in the final part which I’ll be buying in a couple of weeks when it comes out.

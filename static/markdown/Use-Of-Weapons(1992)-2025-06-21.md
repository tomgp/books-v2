I enjoy The Culture books but they never quite land for me. On the other hand, the idea of The Culture is just endlessly compelling. I feel like the series is missing a big volume of short stories but given that short stories were never really Bank's thing I think the best expression of the idea is the [Notes on the Culture post](https://www.toffeemilkshake.co.uk/notes/notes-on-the-culture) that his friend Ken MacLeod posted on rec.arts.sf.written back in the mid-nineties.

Another thought: _Special Circumstances_, the branch of The Culture that does war, typically by mans of sending a well resourced individual to an enemy planet and letting them fuck shit up, is basically [Wasp](/book-Wasp(1957))([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasp_(novel)))

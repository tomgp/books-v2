So this took me about 3 months. It’s not particularly a difficult read really, on a sentence by sentence level, but it does require some sustained attention – I’ve been cycling into work 90% of the time so my hour of commuter time reading hasn’t been there plus child care etc. A committed reader could do it in a month or two I expect.

Short version: It’s well worth your time, use two bookmarks.

_there was more but my archiving didn’t get it for some reason, the following bit added Jan 1st 2021 & edited Jan 23rd 2024_

I don’t regret reading this but I no longer think this book is necessarily worth your time. It is good, perhaps even great, but I don’t think it has the property of expanding in your mind over the years that my favourite books do. For a similarly sizes ostentatiously GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL type tomes I’d promote [Dos Passos underated USA Trilogy](/book-USA-Trilogy(1936)).

For post-modern maximalism I'd recomend [The Last Samurai](/book-The-Last-Samurai(2000))

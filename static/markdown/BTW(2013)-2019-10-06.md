A slim early novel (2013 I think) featuring some of the charaters from his later books. I enjoyed this, I enjoy Kobeks prose and I like his characters (though he doesn’t here have the chops in developing character motivation which he displays in eg. [The Future Won’t Be Long](/book-The-Future-Won't-Be-Long(2017)) which leads to some narrative gear grinding… of course in [Only Americans…](/book-Only-Americans-Burn-In-Hell(2019)) this is transmuted into a virtue) highlights in this one for me are the far-out readings of Victorian novels. I’m a fan of Victorian novels and far out readings.

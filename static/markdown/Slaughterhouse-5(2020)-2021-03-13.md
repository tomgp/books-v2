The Slaughterhouse 5 comic was good, faithful with occasional sparks of originality. Ryan North is a great comics writer, reading Adventure Time with _J_ is always a joy but here it feels like he’s perhaps too reverent? I don’t know, it probably takes about the same amount of time to read the novel as it does the adaptation and the original is much deeper and richer and stranger.

Felt rushed and unresolved. The invention and the ingenious grotesqueries of the first novel have at this point become less interesting and the whole didn’t end up feeling coherent. There’s a lot of stuff to be dug into here regarding the use of an African setting and the trilogy’s take on colonialism which I don’t really feel qualified for, suffice it to say that I think there are some problems. Perhaps the series might have worked better as a series of loosely connected short stories/ novelas?

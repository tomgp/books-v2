I didn't get into this one as much as [This Is The Place To Be](book-This-Is-The-Place-To-Be(2016)) which I liked enogh to buy for a couple of people. It's kind of  a psychogeography thing but with objects instead of places, everything freighted with meaning, the longer Pawson looks at things the more stories and memories and associations unfurl. Whilst I wasn't enthralled it was interesting to me specifically because I find the opposite; the more I stare at stuff the more it seems to loose meaning and asscocation. Kind of like [semantic-satiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_satiation), after a while things just turn into shapes and light and dark and what they "are" or "mean" evaporates.

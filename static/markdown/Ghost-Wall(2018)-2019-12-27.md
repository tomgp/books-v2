I finally got round to reading a second Sarah Moss book. I really enjoyed her first, [Cold Earth](/book-Cold-Earth(2009)), nearly 10 years back. In Ghost Wall she’s recognisably the same writer but it’s a more confident more dense book in spite of its tiny page count, something that opens up in your brain in the days after you finish it.

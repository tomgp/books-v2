170pages in, this seems much longer than it needs to be.

_After finishing..._

It had it’s moments but none of those moments were in the first 150 pages or so which for me made the whole thing feel like a bit of a slog. Also, in the end the solution felt like a cheat. Interesting but I didn’t find it that entertaining. I won’t rush to read another Wilkie Collins but I wouldn’t totally rule it out.

It’s a shame this had to share the Booker with Margret Atwood (I’ve not read The Testaments but I’ve always been ambivalent towards her stuff and a sequel to The Handmaids Tale coinciding with a  popular HBO adaptaion of same doesn’t fill me with excitement) though I didn’t pay much attention at the time I’m sure there are some ‘takes’ on the internet which i might look up. Also, look, did you see what just happened? I’m all of a sudden not talking about the book. The book is as you’d probably expect from the surrounding chatter very good, Evaristo has a great command of character and achieves an awful lot with not much, so many characters all alive in a brief novel.

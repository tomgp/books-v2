Finished reading Terry Pratchett’s Mort to K. Interesting to read an earlyish Discworld book, a real feeling of exploring a space that’s unknown but full of promise. I feel like Mort is the point (4th in the series) where Pratchett starts to treat the Discworld books as an on-going thing, there’s a bit more solidity to the world, it’s becoming a bit more than just generic fantasy set dressing for some gags. Mort is one of the best ones, it moves at a fantastic pace and showcases Pratchett’s skill at taking our naive intuitions about how the world works and pushing them to extremes for the sake of jokes and a gentle, never cynical, kind of satire.

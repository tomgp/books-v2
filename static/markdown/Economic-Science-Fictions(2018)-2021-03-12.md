Had some decent pieces but it mostly didn’t click for me. A lot of it had that academic writing thing where I get to the end of an essay and it feels both like i’ve been reading it for years and like I’ve just read the introduction and haven’t got much out of it. I think this is likely as much a fsailing on my part as on any of the academics.

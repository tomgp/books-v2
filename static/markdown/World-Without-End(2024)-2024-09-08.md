Felt like a TED talk (bad thing) and a particularly axe-grindy one at that. Just one persons point of view, shorn of nuance and supporting argument, there are no citations and other arguments and solutions aren't given a hearing. Jean-Marc Jancovici is VERY pro nuclear and is the only person who's voice we hear in the book except the author/illustrator. Some of the discussion (e.g. that around the concepts of energy and power) is just muddled, if I wasn't already familiar with the ideas it would not have lead to a clear understanding.

[here's a good piece on some of the reasons why nuclear isn't the answer](https://davidtoke.substack.com/p/why-small-modular-reactors-do-not)

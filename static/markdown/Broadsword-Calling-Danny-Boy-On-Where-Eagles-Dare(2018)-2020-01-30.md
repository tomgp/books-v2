Short and sweet. It’s basically Dyer recounting the plot and action of Where Eagles Dare decorated with a lifetimes-worth of entertaining observations. I don’t think I’ve seen that film since I was 10 or so. Apropos of nothing, Dyer also has a book called _Yoga For People Who Can’t Be Bothered To Do It_.

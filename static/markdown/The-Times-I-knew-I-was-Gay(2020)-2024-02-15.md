I stumbled across a zine, a kind of first draft of this book, in Gosh comics many years ago and I was immediately charmed. I hadn't thought about it much in the years since, I was vagueuy aware that it was to be expanded and published "properly" but it hadn't relly crossed my mind until I stumbled upon it in [our local library](https://www.haringey.gov.uk/libraries-sport-and-leisure/libraries/hornseylibrary) whilst J was reading chemistry revision books (this is a semi-regular saturday mornig activity for us). Anyway, I do kind of miss the nervy sketchyness of the earlier versions drawings but this is still a great example of the surprisingly crowded comic-memoir genre. 

What is it about comics that lend themselves to this kind of light autobiographical writing I wonder? Relatedly, I really loved Alison Bechdel's [The Secret to Superhuman Strength](book-The-Secret-to-Superhuman-Strength(2021))

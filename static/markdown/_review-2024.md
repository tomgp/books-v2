I read more comics than usual this year. Lack of commuting continued to have an impact on the rate at which I read, combined with the fact that I've been putting more of my free time into playing games and watching films and TV. I didn't buy any new books this year (one or two exceptions) relying instead on what was on our shelves (_Art is Magic_, _How Do You Live_, _Small Gods_), what other family members were reading (_The Trees_, _All Systems Red_, _Jekyll & Hyde_), and the library (_Assembly_, _The Future_, _Our Share Of Night_ and, unfinished at time of writing, Ada Palmer's _Too Like the Lightning_). I'm not going to stick to the no-new-books thing next year but it's hopefully slowed my natural reflex to immediately buy more books once I've finished one. I had planned to finally finish _The Book of the Long Sun_ but it wasn't to be.

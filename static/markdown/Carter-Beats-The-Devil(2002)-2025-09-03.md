A book I've seen around for years but never knew anything about till E was given it for her birthday by a friend. I'd allways assumed from the cover it was a kind of Jasper Fford type comedy caper involving the actual devil rather than a kind of biographical novel based on an [actual person](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Joseph_Carter) (though a skim of his Wikipedia article suggests that the book diverges greatly from reality).

Started off well, lagged in the middle, ended strong. How much of this was to do with the fact that it took me ages to get through the middle bit I don't know. Did it take me ages because I wasn't enjoying it or was I not enjoying it because my reading was too fragmented (tiredness)?

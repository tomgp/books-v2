Michael Pollan surveys the history and recent (~ last 10 years) resurgence in scientific interests in psychedelic drugs. Particularly in the context of mental health and psychotherapy where they appear to have the ability to make profound impacts on otherwise treatment resistant depression.

I really enjoyed the parts about psilocybin and fungi in general, the natural history and the speculation about why they produce mind altering chemicals.

Also interesting was the stuff about the default mode network and the links between meditation/’mindfulness’ practice and the effects of psychedelics.

Pollan’s descriptions of his own trips are perhaps predictably less captivating. Having said that though, the idea emerging from his experience and his committed materialism -- that spiritualism is not the opposite of materialism but rather egotism -- seems like an interesting one and explains why people who bang on about their own spirituality perhaps lack credibility.

Recommended if you like that kind of thing.

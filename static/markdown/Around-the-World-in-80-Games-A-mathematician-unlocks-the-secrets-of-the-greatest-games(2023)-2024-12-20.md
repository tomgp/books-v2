Finishing off last years xmas books. I was skimming this one by the end.
So not great. An easy enough to read but nothing new for anyone who's already au fait with eg. the origins of Monopoly ([it was stolen from someone who was trying to promote georgist land value tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Landlord%27s_Game)), Snakes and Ladders ([hindu moral instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_ladders)) etc.
And for me the maths bits were too few and far between and, when they did appear, not particularly insightful.
